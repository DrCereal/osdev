# OS project name Rainman

Just an OS to help me learn how OSs function. The code will be very hacked together and messy (even though I do **try** to make it look nice) so don't expect anything that great.

Don't ask about the name because I have no clue Xd.

Read TODO.md for tasks that have been completed/planned out.
