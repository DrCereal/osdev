# OS project name Rainman

Just an OS to help me learn how OSs function. The code will be very hacked together and messy (even though I do **try** to make it look nice) so please don't expect anything that great.

Don't ask about the name because I have no clue Xd.

Read TODO.md for tasks that have been completed/planned out.

You can clearly tell by this branch that I did not give up. I originally had, but I noticed that the information I could find on hard drives (OSDevWiki) was quite scarce and, in my opinion, was a little bit lacking in explanation. Because of this, I will be continuing development on the floppy drive driver.

**Hard drives** will **not** be neglected though, I will move on to them when I get to it. (As stated on 'TODO.md')
