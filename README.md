# My "Operating system"
Very hacked together code. It will remain this way because I plan to restart sometime in the future!

I expect you to already have a cross compiler to compile this code with. View the Makefile for more information.

I will eventually add a link so you can download a pre-built cross compiler.

Had to reset repo because of a mistake I had made. (whoops)
